# 👋 Hi! My name is Augusto Llopis

### Frontend Developer & UI/UX Enthusiast exploring AI in design workflows

---

I'm transitioning into web development after more than 6 years working as a sous-chef in the hospitality industry. Creativity has always been part of my life — I studied graphic design after high school and took early courses in HTML and CSS. Now, at 32, I'm fully committed to starting a new chapter in tech.

Over the past year, I've been learning the fundamentals of frontend development. I’ve built projects using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**, and tools like **SASS**, **Gulp**, **GitHub**, and **Netlify**. I'm also comfortable with **Figma** and **Illustrator**, and I enjoy exploring creative layouts, animations, and modern UI design — especially those incorporating **AI-generated assets** and unique visual styles.

Currently, I'm sharpening my JavaScript skills and diving into **React**. My goal is to become a web designer/developer focused on clean, interactive, and user-centered web experiences. I’m also exploring AI tools like **GitHub Copilot** to enhance my workflow and stay at the cutting edge of modern development.

📍 Based in **Porto, Portugal** | 🌐 Open to **remote opportunities**
